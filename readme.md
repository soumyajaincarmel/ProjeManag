## Future Scope

There are certain features that I plan to inculcate in future, so the Future Scope of this Project is as follows : 

●	Remodel the Project to use MVVM App Architecture (ViewModel and LiveData).

●	Turn the Multi Activity App to Single Activity and Multiple Fragments.

●	Integrate seamlessly with the apps and services the team relies on like Slack, Dropbox, Outlook, Gmail, Salesforce, InVision, Jira, and hundreds more.

●	Use a RESTful API instead of Firebase Firestore Database.
